NATS is a connective technology built for the ever increasingly hyper-connected world. It is a single technology that enables applications to securely communicate across any combination of cloud vendors, on-premise, edge, web and mobile, and devices.
NATS consists of a family of open source products that are tightly integrated but can be deployed easily and independently. NATS is being used globally by thousands of companies, spanning use-cases including microservices, edge computing, mobile, IoT and can be used to augment or replace traditional messaging.

The NATS Server acts as a central nervous system for building distributed applications. Official clients are available in Go, Rust, JavaScript (Node and Web), TypeScript (Deno), Python, Java, C#, C, Ruby, Elixir and a CLI in addition to 30+ community-contributed clients. Real time data streaming, highly resilient data storage and flexible data retrieval are supported through [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/jetstream/), the next generation streaming platform built into the NATS server. Check out the full list of [NATS clients](/download).

NATS was created by Derek Collison, in response to the market need for a simple, secure, and connective technology. NATS is currently deployed in some of the largest cloud platforms, including: VMware, CloudFoundry, Baidu, Siemens, and GE. NATS is 100% free to use under the Apache-2.0 Open Source License.

NATS is unique in its simplicity and performance, and as a result powers some of the largest production environments. You can learn more about NATS in our [extensive documentation](https://docs.nats.io).

## Roadmap

Features being included in the next release are tracked on [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/milestones).  


The purpose of the roadmap is to communicate the known set of features and changes coming in a release. Each release contains a set of strategic and high-value changes decided by the NATS maintainers. There are several sources of input for this decision making:

- Community, driven by GitHub and Slack interest and discussions
- Customers, solicited from [Synadia's](https://www.synadia.com?utm_source=nats_io&utm_medium=nats) customer use cases
- Support, sourced from recurring challenges with existing capabilities
- Opportunity, ideated by the maintainers insight and vision

We are excited to bring these advances to the NATS community and look forward to your valuable input! Feel free to reach out on our [Slack channel](https://slack.nats.io), start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/discussions), or [email us](mailto:info@nats.io) with any questions, comments, or requests.

Nightly container image builds are available during development on Docker Hub under the [`synadia/nats-server:nightly`](https://hub.docker.com/r/synadia/nats-server) repo.
